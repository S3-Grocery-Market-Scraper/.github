Grocery shopping now a days feels like this gif above. Everything is expensive and trying to figure out where to buy the cheapest products is a hassle.
I used to try to keep track of this inside an gaint spreadsheet, but the scope of my sheet grew larger and larger to the point it was becoming more work to keep track of everything, so I gave up with this project. 

This has inspired me to create an application that keeps track of all the prices of products in the different grocery stores. Jumbo, Albert Hein, Lidl, Aldi etc. Everything inside one platform for you to keep track of prices and plan your grocery shopping experience as efficiently as possible.
